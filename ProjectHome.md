Skylight1 is an open source Java mobile projects framework and collection of Android applications and demos. This group started in Feb 2009 as part of the [NYCJava](http://meetup.com/nycjava) Java User Group with the revenue from the project's initial applications going to the [NYPC Users Group](http://nypc.org), a 501c3 educational non-profit. Our first project, "Balance the Beer" had over 450K downloads.

This project is also affiliated with the NYC GDG (Google Developer Group) http://meetup.com/nyc-gdg and the New York Android Developers Meetup [http://meetup.com/android-developers-nyc (join those to get meeting notifications)


**To join please come to a public meeting first (listed on NYC-GDG Meetup calendar) then request membership here:

**News:**

We have several ongoing projects (including Android Wear and Google Glass) and are open to additional ideas/members.  We meet weekly (except during holidays). Come prepared to code with laptop - all levels welcome but this is hands on.  We now have github and a private g+ community group.

Usually this is not a lecture oriented group but on occasion we do have presentations. Starting in January, we will be working alongside a weekly free Android course sponsored by Google/Udacity/NYC-GDG.

One recent Glass project was created in support of http://beaconcrawl.com and supported Android Wear as well. Another is a recent submission to NYCBigApps Challenge called, http://wearabouts.splashthat.com/|WearAbouts

**Previous News:**

The official [OHNY (Open House New York) Weekend Android Application](http://code.google.com/p/skylight1/source/browse/#svn/trunk/OHNYWknd) is available on the market. note: art work used by permission, copyright by http://ohny.org

Live wallpaper application "Fingerprint Live Wallpaper" avail under demos and Market (2.0+ only)

We developed and released (in 1 day, Dec 30-31, 2009) "Toast" as a result of not finding an equivalent of the "Clink-Clink" iPhone app on the Android Market - and just in time for New Years Eve.

We released ['NYC Events'](http://.nycjava.net/nycevents) on the Android Market in Dec 2009. This lists NYC Parks, Art and Music events based on data provided by NYC.gov. We submitted to the [http://nycbigapps.com](http://www.nycbigapps.com/application-gallery/nyc-events-parks-art-and-music) challenge.

We launched our first app, a game based on the framework to the Android Market in late Sept 2009. It's called ['Balance the Beer'](http://balancethebeer.com) and currently is approaching 250K downloads and reaching #31 under casual games and featured briefly on the Google market website. Please give it a good rating on the market ;-)

**Status:**

Current ongoing large projects: the Places and Events (P&E) framework and Seven Wonders (7W), a 3D OpenGL game.  To participate, stop by a [NYC Java Meetup](http://meetup.com/nycjava) meeting or visit http://nycjava.net for more info.
