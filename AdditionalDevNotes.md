**Requirement for some of the non-Android Eclipse projects checked out from svn:**

Go to Eclipse prefs->Java->Build Path->Classpath Variables->New...

add a variable name ANDROID\_LIB whose value is the path to your Android SDK's android.jar file (either platform for now but better go with 1.5 in case)
