|2|The system presents instructions to the current user (in example game, via a video)|
|3|The system introduces the game and provides an option to start a game at a level (e.g. easy, medium, hard).|
|4|The user selects the option to start a game.|
|5|The user holds the device such that the camera is obscured. (deprecated)|
|6|The system provides a three second _start count-down_, and then begins to communicate to the user how the device must be moved, and shows a _passing count-down_. (deprecated)|
|7|The user plays the skill test game successfully for n (15) seconds |
|8|The system presents the user with a success animation, and then resumes at step 6 with the new user and skill level is increased.|

**Alternate Flow: User fails skill test activity**
